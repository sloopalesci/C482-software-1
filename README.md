# C482-software-1

Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications with various features and functionality based on business requirements. For this assessment, you will create a Java desktop application using the solution statements provided in the requirements section of this assessment.



The skills you showcase in your completed application will be useful in responding to technical interview questions for future employment. This application may also be added to your portfolio to show to future employers.



The preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for this assignment is NetBeans version 11.1 or later or IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition). Use the links in the web links section of this assessment to install one of these IDEs. If you choose to use another IDE, you must export your project into NetBeans 11.1 or later or IntelliJ IDEA format or your submission will be returned.



This assessment also requires the following software: the latest long term support (LTS) version of JDK and JavaFX SDK or Module (for NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA), and Scene Builder, which are also available for download in the web links section of this assessment, as well as a video demonstration of the completed application.



Your submission should include a zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application. Your submission should also include a folder with descriptive Javadoc comments in the .java files. The zip file submission must keep the project file and folder structure intact for the IDE.



In NetBeans, zip your file by going to File > Export Project > To ZIP and click Export. In IntelliJ IDEA, go to File > Export to Zip File and click OK. If you try to zip your project files with an external program, it will include the build files and make the zip files too large for submission.
